Hi everyone,

here you can find my solutions to the Advent of Code 2022 assignments. They are all solved in Python.
I am using the advent of code to learn Python and discover as many built in functions as i can.

Missing days are those in which I had some difficulties and not figured out how to solve :)

Hope you enjoy my solutions,
see you!
